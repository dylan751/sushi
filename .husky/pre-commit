There is something wrong with your branch name. 
Branch names in this project must adhere to this regex: $valid_branch_regex

Quick tip: please use the Github issue number and describe the content of the branch in few words:
{feat,fix,hotfix,refactor,perf,chore,docs}/{github issue number}_{custom branch name}
E.g.: feat/1234-super-duper-feature (you can use underscore as well feat/1234_super_duper_feature)

For epic branch please use the format: epic/{custom branch name} (e.g.: epic/cost-insight)
For demo branch please use the format: demo/{custom branch name} (e.g.: demo/cost-insight)

If you still want to use this branch name ($local_branch_name), please set the env variable HUSKY_IGNORE_BRANCH_NAMING and try again.
